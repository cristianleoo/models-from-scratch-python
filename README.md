## About the Project

This repository is aimed at providing an educational resource for those seeking to understand the inner workings of machine learning algorithms. While these implementations may not match the efficiency or completeness of mature libraries like `scikit-learn`, the focus here is on simplicity and clarity, allowing users to see the mechanics behind each algorithm.

Each subfolder contains a `demo.ipynb` notebook that demonstrates a practical application of the corresponding algorithm. This includes loading a dataset, performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), and fitting the model to the data.

In addition to the code, a series of articles have been published that provide detailed explanations of each model. These articles cover the mathematical foundations, use cases, assumptions, advantages, and limitations of each algorithm, as well as a thorough breakdown of the corresponding Python implementation. For a deeper understanding, I highly recommend referring to these articles.
